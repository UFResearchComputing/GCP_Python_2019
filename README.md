# GCP_Python_2019

This repository is for the Gator Computing Program 2019 Python lessons at the University of Florida Research Computing.

## Lessons

The easiest way to run the first two lessons is to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) on your computer. In addition to Anaconda, install [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). The easiest way to do that is to use your terminal (MacOS) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows) to run `pip install pygame`.

### Cloning this site onto your flash drive

Open Git bash from the Winows > Git > Git bash menu ![Opening Git Bash](assets\notebook_images\Git_Bash_Launch.png)

Your USB flash drive should be drive D:. If so, in the Git Bash window, type: `cd d:`
Then type `git clone ` and right click to paste the link (you CANNOT use control-V here to paste).
Then hit Enter. Your window should look like this.

### Learning Python Through `pygame`

#### [Lesson 1: Bouncy Ball](Lesson_1_BouncyBall/Bouncy_Intro.ipynb) 
This is the first lesson and teaches many basic Python programming concepts through a simple bouncing ball "game". 

This lesson uses a Jupyter notebook. Open the Anaconda Prompt from Windows > Anaconda > Anaconda Prompt
![Launch Anaconda Prompt](assets\notebook_images\Anaconda_Prompt_Launch.png)

Once the terminal opens, we need to navigate to your cloned repository on the USB drive.

Type: `d:`
Type: `cd GCP_Python_2019/Lesson_1_BouncyBall`
Type: `jupyter notebook`

Once your web browser opens, click on the Bouncy_Intro.ipynb.

#### [Lesson 2: Chimp Game](Lesson_2_Chimp\chimp.py) 
The second lesson is a series of pages that lead you through the inner workings of a simple game.
